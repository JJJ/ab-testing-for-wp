<section class="faq">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>How does A/B Testing for WordPress measure tests?</h2>
    <p>
      When a visitor sees a test variant the visitor will be remembered as a participant of that
      variant. When the visitor visits the goal of the test, the visitor will also be counted as a
      conversion of the variant.
    </p>
    <p>
      A/B Testing for WordPress will calculate the percentage of the participants who became
      conversions and determines a winning variant through these numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can setup pages, posts and outbound links as goals. A/B Testing for WordPress also
      integrates with popular plugins.
    </p>
    <h2>Does A/B Testing for WordPress affect SEO?</h2>
    <p>
      No. Only the control version of your test is shown to search engines and website caches.
      The variant which the visitor will see is replaced using JavaScript.
    </p>
    <h2>Can I convert existing content into an A/B test?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes. Existing content blocks can be converted into A/B tests in the editor. You can find this
      options under "more options" of your blocks. It will take your block and wrap it in an A/B
      test and put a copy of the block in both variants.
    </p>
    <h2>Does A/B Testing for WordPress allow weight distribution?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes. You can change the amount of visitors should see each variant.
    </p>
    <h2>What does A/B Testing for WordPress count as a goal?</h2>
    <p>
      You can pick a post, page, and outbound link as a goal to track. Counting custom post types
      as a conversion goal is not possible (yet).
    </p>
    <p>
      A/B Testing for WordPress also integrates with popular plugins which can be setup as goals.
    </p>
    <h2>How Can I Add a Test to my Site?</h2>
    <p>
      You can enter tests right in the content of your pages and posts through the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or create a separate test which you can place anywhere on your site using a shortcode. Works
      with any template!
