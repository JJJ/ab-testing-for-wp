== Description ==

Create A/B tests right in the content editor. Test which button colour works best, what content drives people to engage, or anything you can imagine!

A/B Testing for WordPress allows you to create split tests right from the visual content editor. Measures the results of your added tests and shows you which variant is the most optimal choice.

You add a block to your content which you can fill with anything you want to and switch between variants instantaneously. Define distribution weight, pick a goal of the test, pick the control variant and off you go!

Everything has been implemented with SEO in the back of my mind, which means the plugin will do nothing to affect your SEO. It works just like most A/B testing tools out there, but directly from your own WordPress site without the use of 3th-party services.

== Installation ==
1. Upload "ab-testing-for-wp" folder to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" screen in WordPress.
1. You can now add tests to your content!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is A/B Testing for WordPress free to use? =
Yes.

= How does A/B Testing for WordPress measure tests? =
When a visitor sees a test variant the visitor will be logged as a participant of that variant. When the visitor visits the goal page of the test, the visitor will also be logged as a conversion of the variant.

A/B Testing for WordPress will calculate the percentage of the participants who became conversions and determines a winning variant through these numbers.

= Does A/B Testing for WordPress affect SEO? =
No. Only the control version of your test is shown to search engines and website caches. The variant which the visitor will see is replaced using JavaScript.

= Does A/B Testing for WordPress allow weight distribution? =
Yes. You can change the amount of visitors should see each variant.

= What does A/B Testing for WordPress count as a goal? =
Currently you can only pick local pages as a goal to track. Counting outbound links as conversion is not possible (yet).

= How can I contribute to this plugin? =
You can find the [source and repository over at GitHub](https://github.com/Gaya/ab-testing-for-wp).
